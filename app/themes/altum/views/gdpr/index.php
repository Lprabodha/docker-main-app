            <h2>5- What are your rights as a user?</h2>
            <p><u>Right of access</u>: The affected party shall have the right to obtain confirmation from the data controller as to whether or not personal data concerning him or her is being processed.</p>
            <p><u>Right of rectification</u>: the affected party shall have the right to obtain, without undue delay, from the data controller the rectification of personal data that is inaccurate and that affects him directly. Likewise, the interested party will have the right to complete incomplete personal data, including by means of an additional declaration.</p>
            <p><u>Right of deletion</u>: It is the right of the affected party to obtain, without undue delay, from the data controller the deletion of the personal data that concerns him.</p>
            <p><u>Right to limit data processing</u>: consists in obtaining the limitation of the processing of your data by the person in charge, although its exercise has two aspects: 1) When you challenge the accuracy of your personal data, during a period that allows the person in charge to verify it and 2) When you have objected to the processing of your personal data that the person in charge carries out based on legitimate interest or a mission of public interest, while the person in charge verifies whether these reasons prevail over yours.</p>
            <p><u>Right to data portability</u>: It is the right of the affected party to receive the personal data that concerns him, that he has provided to a data controller, in a structured format, of common use and mechanical reading, and to transmit them to another controller without being prevented by the controller to whom they were provided.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">In this sense, the interested party will have the right to have personal data transmitted directly from controller to controller when technically possible.</p>
            <h2>6- How can you exercise your rights?</h2>
            <p>You can exercise your personal data rights at any time by sending an email to: support@qrfy.com Or the postal address: Av. Cerdanyola, 75 - 1º, CP 08172, Sant Cugat del Vallés, Barcelona, Spain. In both cases, you must identify yourself with your name and surnames, as well as a copy of your DNI or national ID, if necessary.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">In addition, if you consider that there is a problem with the way QRFY is handling your data, you can direct your claims to the <a href="">data protection authority</a> that corresponds, being the <a href="">Spanish Agency for Data Protection</a> the one indicated in the case of Spain.</p>
            <h2>7- Are security measures adopted?</h2>
            <p>The Service takes all necessary technical and organizational measures to protect the security and integrity of personal and non-personal information collected. Both against unauthorized access and accidental alteration, loss or destruction.</p>
            <p>In any case, the Service cannot guarantee the absolute security of the information collected, so you must collaborate and use common sense at all times regarding shared information.</p>
            <p class="mb-0">You understand and acknowledge that, even after deletion, Personal and Non-Personal Information may remain viewable in cache or if copied or stored by other users.</p>
            <h2>8- Are there transfers of personal data or international transfers?</h2>
            <p>We do not transfer data or international transfers. However, there are third parties that manage part of the Service that we require to comply with our Privacy Policy insofar as it is applicable to them and that they have their own. These third parties are service providers that perform functions on our behalf, such as web hosting, analytics monitoring, or web development.</p>
            <p>Also, if we believe that it is reasonably necessary to satisfy any law, legal process or legitimate interest. In any case, we will only provide the strictly required information.</p>
